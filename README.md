# Diablo
Reverse engineering program using a driver for memory operations. 

**As of now I haven't decided to post the library that I use for process handling so I will leave that up to the reader to add themselves.**

# Features

## Driver Implementation
This can be easily rewritten for use with a driver. This way these features can be used on protected processes. For the past year or so I have used this for dumping protected processes to suit my reverse engineering needs. I have also injected numerous dlls into games protected by various anticheats. The code is designed to be modular so one could easily modify it to fit their needs such as the memory allocation for the DLL injection.
